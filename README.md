# commercial_petproject

Start a project with:

docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:
```bash
# To run all migrations untill the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:
```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate

# For empty file generation.

```


## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . run --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```

For running tests on your local machine.
1. you need to start a database.

I prefer doing it with docker:
```
docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=commercial_petproject" -e "POSTGRES_USER=commercial_petproject" -e "POSTGRES_DB=commercial_petproject" postgres:13.4-buster
```


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
